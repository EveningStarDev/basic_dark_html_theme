# basic_dark_html_theme
A slightly modified version of VS Code's "Dark (Visual Studio)" default dark theme.

- Everything is basically the same, but token colors were modified to make HTML code slightly dimmer.
- The status bar is dark gray now instead of purple.
- Text for comments and attributes now has italics styling.
